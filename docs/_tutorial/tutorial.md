# iFEM Tutorial

iFEM is a MATLAB software package containing robust, efficient, and easy-following codes for the main building blocks of adaptive finite element methods on unstructured simplicial grids in both two and three dimensions. Besides the simplicity and readability, *sparse matrixlization*, an innovative programming style for MATLAB, is introduced to improve the efficiency.

This tutorial gives a quick introduction to essentials of iFEM. Read [Introduction](introduction.html) for more detailed discussion.
